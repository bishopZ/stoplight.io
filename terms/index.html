      <div class="Terms-section">1. StopLight Services</div>

      <div class="Terms-subsection">1.1 Stoplight Services.</div>
      <p>
        The Services enable users to, among other things, create and build API descriptions (<b>“API Documentation”</b>) based on the user’s specifications, and to test the user’s API(s) against that API Documentation. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including your payment obligations, Stoplight grants to You a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, during the term of this Agreement, to access and use the Services solely for your internal business purposes.
      </p>

      <div class="Terms-subsection">1.2 Stoplight Software.</div>
      <p>
        Stoplight’s Website may also make software and associated documentation available for download (<b>“Software”</b>).  Any use of the Software is governed by the terms of the license agreement that accompanies or is included with the Software, or by the license agreement expressly stated on the Website page(s) accompanying the Software.  These license terms may be posted with the Software downloads or at the Website page where the Software can be accessed.  You shall not use, download or install any Software that is accompanied by or includes a license agreement unless you agree to the terms of such license agreement.  At no time will Stoplight provide you with any tangible copy of our Software.  Stoplight shall deliver access to the Software via electronic transfer or download and shall not use or deliver any tangible media in connection with the (a) delivery, installation, updating or problem resolution of any Software (including any new releases); or (b) delivery, correction or updating of documentation.  For the purposes of this section tangible media shall include, but not be limited to, any tape disk, compact disk, card, flash drive, or any other comparable physical medium.  Unless the accompanying license agreement expressly allows otherwise, any copying or redistribution of the Software is prohibited, including any copying or redistribution of the Software to any other server or location, or redistribution or use on a service bureau basis.  If there is any conflict between this Agreement and the license agreement, the license agreement shall take precedence in relation to that Software (except as provided in the following sentence). If the Software is a pre-release version, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary included within an accompanying license agreement, you are not permitted to use or otherwise rely on the Software for any commercial or production purposes.  If no license agreement accompanies use of the Software, use of the Software will be governed by this Agreement.  Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, Stoplight grants you a non-assignable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable non-exclusive license to use the Software for the sole purpose of enabling you to use the Services in the manner permitted by this Agreement.  Some Software may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of these terms.
      </p>

      <div class="Terms-subsection">1.3 Authorized Users.</div>
      <p>
        You may permit any Authorized Users (as defined below) to access and use the features and functions of the  Service as contemplated by this Agreement.   Each Authorized User will be assigned a unique user identification name and password (<b>“User ID”</b>) for access to and use of the Service.  User IDs cannot be shared or used by more than one Authorized User at a time.  If you wish to add additional User IDs, you may order such additional User IDs at any time by registering for additional user accounts via the Website.  Upon written acceptance by Stoplight, Stoplight shall make the Service(s) available to the additional Authorized Users. As used herein, “<b>Authorized User</b>” means any individual who is your employee or such other person or entity that has been authorized to access the Service pursuant to your rights under this Agreement, through the purchase of a user seat via the Website.
      </p>

      <div class="Terms-subsection">1.4 Limitations.</div>
      <p>
        You will not, and will not permit any Authorized User or other party to: (a) access or copy any data or information of other Stoplight subscribers without their consent; (b) knowingly interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service or the data contained therein; (c) harass or interfere with another subscriber’s use and enjoyment of the Service or Software; (d) reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any component of the Service or Software; (e) interfere in any manner with the operation of the Service, or the hardware and network used to operate the Service; (f) sublicense any of your rights under this Agreement, or otherwise use the Service or Software for the benefit of a third party or to operate a service bureau; (g) modify, copy or make derivative works based on any part of the Software or Service; or (j) otherwise use the Service in any manner that exceeds the scope of use permitted under this Agreement.  You acknowledges and agrees that the  Service will not be used, and are not licensed for use, in connection with any of your time-critical or mission-critical functions.
      </p>

      <div class="Terms-section">2. Registration</div>

      <p>
        In order to access certain features of the Service and Software, you may be required to register for an account on the Website (<b>“Account”</b>). In registering for the Services, you agree to (1) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Services’ registration form (the “Registration Data”); and (2) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. You are responsible for all activities that occur under your Account. You may not share your Account or password with anyone, and you agree to (1) notify Stoplight immediately of any unauthorized use of your password or any other breach of security; and (2) exit from your Account at the end of each session.  If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or Stoplight has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, Stoplight has the right to suspend or terminate your Account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Website, Software and Services (or any portion thereof).
      </p>

      <div class="Terms-section">3. Fees and Expenses; Payments</div>

      <div class="Terms-subsection">3.1 Fees and Payment.</div>
      <p>
        You agree to pay all fees or charges to your Account in accordance with the fees, charges and billing terms in effect at the time a fee or charge is due and payable. You must provide Stoplight with a valid credit card (Visa, MasterCard, or any other issuer accepted by us) (<b>“Payment Provider”</b>), or purchase order information as a condition to signing up for the Services.  Your Payment Provider agreement governs your use of the designated credit card, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities.  By providing Stoplight with your credit card number and associated payment information, you agree that Stoplight is authorized to immediately invoice your Account for all fees and charges due and payable to Stoplight hereunder and that no additional notice or consent is required.  You agree to immediately notify Stoplight of any change in your billing address or the credit card used for payment hereunder.  Stoplight reserves the right at any time to change its prices and billing methods, either immediately upon posting on the Website or Services or by e-mail delivery to you.
      </p>

      <div class="Terms-subsection">3.2 Service Subscription Fees.</div>
      <p>
        You will be responsible for payment of the applicable fee for any Services (each, a <b>“Service Subscription Fee”</b>) at the time you create your Account and select your monthly or annual package, as applicable (each, a <b>“Service Commencement Date”</b>).  Except as set forth in this Agreement, all fees for the Services are non-refundable.  No contract will exist between you and Stoplight for the Services until Stoplight accepts your order by a confirmatory e-mail, SMS/MMS message, or other appropriate means of communication. Your subscription will continue indefinitely until terminated in accordance with this Agreement.  After your initial subscription period, and again after any subsequent subscription period, your subscription will automatically commence on the first day following the end of such period (each, a <b>“Renewal Commencement Date”</b>) and continue for an additional equivalent period, at Stoplight’s then-current price for such subscription. You agree that your Account will be subject to this automatic renewal feature unless you cancel your subscription at any time prior to the Renewal Commencement Date by logging into and going to the Account settings page. If you cancel your subscription, you may use your subscription until the end of your then-current subscription term; your subscription will not be renewed after your then-current term expires.  However, you will not be eligible for a prorated refund of any portion of the subscription fee paid for the then-current subscription period. By subscribing, you authorize Stoplight to charge your Payment Provider now, and again at the beginning of any subsequent subscription period. Upon renewal of your subscription, if Stoplight does not receive payment from your Payment Provider, (i) you agree to pay all amounts due on your Account upon demand, and/or (ii) you agree that Stoplight may either terminate or suspend your subscription and continue to attempt to charge your Payment Provider until payment is received (upon receipt of payment, your Account will be activated and for purposes of automatic renewal, your new subscription commitment period will begin as of the day payment was received).
      </p>

      <div class="Terms-subsection">3.3 Taxes.</div>
      <p>
        Stoplight’s fees are net of any applicable Sales Tax.  If any Services or Software, or payments for any Services or Software, under this Agreement are subject to Sales Tax in any jurisdiction and you have not remitted the applicable Sales Tax to Stoplight, you will be responsible for the payment of such Sales Tax and any related penalties or interest to the relevant tax authority, and you will indemnify Stoplight for any liability or expense Stoplight may incur in connection with such Sales Taxes.  Upon our request, you will provide us with official receipts issued by the appropriate taxing authority, or other such evidence that you have paid all applicable taxes.  For purposes of this section, <b>“Sales Tax”</b> shall mean any sales or use tax, and any other tax measured by sales proceeds, that Stoplight is permitted to pass to its customers, that is the functional equivalent of a sales tax where the applicable taxing jurisdiction does not otherwise impose a sales or use tax.
      </p>


      <div class="Terms-section">4. Ownership; Licenses</div>

      <div class="Terms-subsection">4.1 StopLight Ownership.</div>
      <p>
        As between Stoplight and you, the Services, Website, Software and all content therein (excluding Your Content) (collectively, the <b>“Stoplight Properties”</b>) and all worldwide Intellectual Property Rights in each of the foregoing, are the exclusive property of Stoplight and its suppliers.  All rights in and to Stoplight Properties not expressly granted to you in this Agreement are reserved by Stoplight and its suppliers.  Except as expressly set forth herein, no express or implied license or right of any kind is granted to you regarding Stoplight Properties or any part thereof, including any right to obtain possession of any source code, data or other technical material related to the Software.
      </p>

      <div class="Terms-subsection">4.2 Your Content.</div>
      <p>
        Stoplight acknowledges and agrees that you are, as between Stoplight and you, the exclusive owner of the API Documentation and the APIs, specifications, content and other data uploaded by you to the Service or Software (collectively, <b>“Your Content”</b>). To the extent Stoplight has any ownership interest in or to Your Content, Stoplight hereby assigns (excluding the Stoplight Properties) Your Content to you, including all intellectual property rights therein. However, in order to enable Stoplight to provide the Services to you, you hereby grant Stoplight a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free and fully paid license to use the Your Content as necessary for purposes of providing the Services.

      </p>

      <div class="Terms-section">6. Indemnification</div>

      <p>
        You agree to indemnify and hold Stoplight, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, employees, agents, partners and licensors (collectively, the <b>“Stoplight Parties”</b>) harmless from any losses, costs, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) relating to or arising out of: (a) Your Content; (b) your use of, or inability to use, the Stoplight Properties; (c) your violation of this Agreement; (d) your violation of any rights of another party; or (e) your violation of any applicable laws, rules or regulations.  Stoplight reserves the right, at its own cost, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with Stoplight in asserting any available defenses.  You agree that the provisions in this section will survive any termination of your Account, this Agreement or your access to the Stoplight Properties.

      </p>

      <ol class="Terms-list">
        <li>
          <i>Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.</i> All claims and disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief as set forth below) in connection with this Agreement or the use of any product or service provided by Stoplight that cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the terms of this Arbitration Agreement.  This Arbitration Agreement applies to you and Stoplight, and to any subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or goods provided under this Agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution.</i> Before either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to the other party a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and the requested relief.  A Notice to Stoplight should be sent to the following email: legal@stoplight.io.  After the Notice is received, you and Stoplight will attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.  If you and Stoplight do not resolve the claim or dispute within 30 days after the Notice is received, either party may begin an arbitration proceeding.  The amount of any settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Arbitration Rules.</i> Arbitration shall be initiated through the American Arbitration Association (<b>“AAA”</b>), an established alternative dispute resolution provider (<b>“ADR Provider”</b>) that offers arbitration as set forth in this section.  If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall agree to select an alternative ADR Provider.  The rules of the ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of this arbitration, including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in conflict with this Agreement. The AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules governing the arbitration are available online at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  The arbitration shall be conducted by a three, neutral arbitrators.  Any claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may  be resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option of the party seeking relief.  For claims or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules.  Any hearing will be held in Wilmington, Delaware, unless the parties agree otherwise.  Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Each party shall bear its own costs (including attorney’s fees) and disbursements arising out of the arbitration, and shall pay an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Additional Rules for Non-appearance Based Arbitration</i> If non-appearance arbitration is elected, the arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration.  The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Time Limits.</i> If you or Stoplight pursue arbitration, the arbitration action must be initiated and/or demanded within the statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for the pertinent claim.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Authority of Arbitrator.</i> If arbitration is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and Stoplight, and the dispute will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and this Agreement.  The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and Stoplight.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Waiver of Jury Trial.</i> THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement.  Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court.  In the event any litigation should arise between you and Stoplight in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND STOPLIGHT WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</i> ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Confidentiality.</i> All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, including but not limited to the award of the arbitrator and compliance therewith, shall be strictly confidential. The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless otherwise required by law.  This Paragraph shall not prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or equitable relief.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Severability.</i> If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Right to Waive.</i> Any or all of the rights and limitations set forth in this Agreement may be waived by the party against whom the claim is asserted.  Such waiver shall not waive or effect any other portion of this Agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Survival of Agreement.</i> This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Stoplight.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Small Claims Court.</i> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Stoplight may bring an individual action in small claims court.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Emergency Equitable Relief.</i> Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration.  A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Claims Not Subject To Arbitration.</i> Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party’s patent, copyright, trademark, or trade secret shall not be subject to this arbitration agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Courts.</i> In any circumstances where the foregoing Agreement permits the parties to litigate in court, the parties hereby agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Wilmington, Delaware for such purpose.
        </li>
      </ol>
